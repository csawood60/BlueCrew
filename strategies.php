                        <p class="body-text">
                            Culture is what gives an organization its
                            power. It permeates all of our operations
                            and teams, binding us together for good or
                            ill. Whether we acknowledge it or not, there
                            is always power in our company's culture.
                            Always.<br><br>

                            <strong>When we are intentional about driving positive
                            culture...</strong><br>
                            we can harness that power to increase employee
                            engagement and productivity. Additionally,
                            culture and brand go hand in hand, so a strong
                            positive culture can go a long way toward
                            positioning your company as a front-runner in
                            your industry.<br><br>

                            <strong>​If we ignore culture in the workplace...</strong><br>
                            we do so at our own peril. Culture exists
                            regardless of our attentiveness. When ignored,
                            it becomes toxic and destructive, causing
                            uncertainty and concern among employees, which
                            in turns leads to poor productivity and
                            increased turnover costs.<br><br>

                                Gone are the days when employees were
                                evaluated only annually. Employees
                                thrive in an environment of frequent
                                feedback and recognition. Without such
                                an environment, employees become
                                misaligned with company objectives, find
                                themselves uncertain of their role, and
                                lose their desire to excel.
                                <br><br>

                                <strong>Gather candid employee feedback.</strong><br>
                                Building shared meaning with our
                                employees can be invaluable. Management
                                teams often become entrenched in stale
                                patterns, and alternate points of view
                                can break the cycle and illuminate
                                opportunities for improvement. Without
                                well-established and safe channels of
                                communication, employees will either
                                suffer in silence or eventually express
                                their feedback in unproductive
                                ways.<br><br>

                                <strong>Recognize excellence in every employee.</strong><br>
                                We make a commitment when we hire an
                                employee. A good manager recognizes
                                that everyone has opportunities for
                                improvement. Great managers can
                                identify moments of greatness in every
                                employee, even if they are not a
                                natural-born world-shaker. Shining a

                                encourages our better angels to overcome

                                Operating from a growth mindset, we
                                realize that all persons in any
                                situation can grow and improve.  This
                                frame of mind allows us to have a
                                realistic expectation that any employee,
                                managed properly, can excel in their
                                profession.  It is also important to
                                note that every dollar spent on
                                developing employees has a measurable
                                benefit to productivity and
                                profitability.<br><br>

                                <strong>Supervisor Responsibility</strong><br>
                                The old paradigm attempts to prove that
                                the employer made a good-faith effort to
                                give the employee ample opportunity to
                                comply.  When that effort has been
                                willfully rebuffed the employer
                                supposedly is left with no choice other
                                than termination.  The flaw in this
                                logic is that it disregards the
                                supervisor's responsibility to develop
                                talent and expand the capabilities of
                                their team. Front line supervisors can
                                be either our greatest asset or our
                                greatest liability.<br><br>

                                <strong>Individualized Approach</strong><br>
                                Employee development programs on a large scale
                                are laudable, but engaging with every employee
                                identically is like trying to eat fifty hard
                                boiled eggs in one sitting.  You are going to
                                lose more than a few.<br><br>


                                <strong>Performance Management</strong><br>
                                Employee development programs on a large
                                scale are laudable, but trying to
                                develop every employee identically
                                alienates a significant portion of your
                                workforce.  Remember that employees are
                                like snowflakes: no two are the same.
                                Also, a lot of them together can make
                                quite an impact.<br><br></p>

                                        is a healthy combination of

                                        Compliance definitely takes
                                        time, effort, and resources.
                                        Considering the potential fines
                                        that can be incurred, however,
                                        the investment is worth the
                                        expense.  For example, an audit
                                        of your I-9s can result in
                                        minimum fines of over $200 per
                                        error, and a fines can be
                                        assessed for multiple errors per
                                        form.  A remediation audit can
                                        save thousands in fines, and
                                        training for supervisors can
                                        resolve problems before they
