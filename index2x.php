                            <p>There are only two types of employers any more:<br>
                                <strong>1) Those who adapt to the evolving landscape of
                                the workforce.</strong><br>
                                These have learned that great
                                employees lead to great products and services,
                                directly contributing to successful business.
                                They are those who recognize the fact that
                                employee demographics are changing, and that
                                organizations must similarly evolve.  They
                                embrace the fact these changes are likely not
                                temporary.</strong><br><br>
                                
                                <strong>​2) Those who do not.</strong><br>
                                These have difficulty adapting to change.  These
                                organizations are dwindling, becoming harder to
                                find.  That's OK, though, because very few
                                clients are trying to find them. So, what do we
                                do now? ​No two organizations are the same, and
                                therefore no two organizations face exactly the
                                same challenges.  Similarly, there is no
                                one-size-fits-all solution, but we do see some
                                similarities in how great organizations approach
                                employee relations.<br><br>
                                Don't be irrelevant.  Engage better with your employees.</p>
