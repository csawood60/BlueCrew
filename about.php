                <h1>Ray Ivy</h1>
                <p> A fifth-generation Texan and a quintessential 
                    member of the Greatest Generation, Ray Ivy consistently demonstrated 
                    a strong reputation for industry, integrity, and community-building.  
                    Breaking horses in the lean years of the 1930s taught him the 
                    necessity and value of hard work, and service as a Sergeant in 
                    the early forties honed his self-confidence and leadership. 
                    After returning home, Ray built roads for the highway department, 
                    where his insight and determination were quickly recognized.  
                    Thereafter, he supervised infrastructure development projects 
                    across the county.<br><br>
                            
                    Throughout his career, Ray stayed connected to the values he had 
                    learned in his youth.  His concern for the well-being of others was 
                    readily apparent in his daily life.  Building homes for others, 
                    providing medication for those who had none, and serving in his 
                    local congregation were just some of the hallmarks of his legacy 
                    of trust and respect in communities across West Texas.<br><br></p>

                <h1>Herman Blau</h1>
                <p> Even from his early years on a sheep ranch in
                    Kansas, Herman Blau built his life around hard work and a 
                    commitment to his community.  As a result of the famine and crop 
                    failures in that region, he relocated to Arizona where he began 
                    anew with a tent and four acres.<br><br>
                            
                    Through several ventures, some more successful than others, he was 
                    consistently recognized as an exceptional business partner, developing
                    a reputation of reliability and expertise that won the trust of customers 
                    and business partners alike.  Because of this, he was recruited to join 
                    a growing plumbing services company, where he ultimately assumed 
                    responsibility for all business operations.<br><br>
                                    
                    Herman created success through diligent and purposeful effort, 
                    and he utilized that success to aid those around him.  Many times, 
                    when a client's bill came due, he gently declined payment from a 
                    customer when he felt that it would be more beneficial to build up 
                    those around him.  Viewing his achievements as a means and not an 
                    end, he ensured that his vision was always focused on benefiting 
                    his community, his neighbors, and his family.<br><br></p>
