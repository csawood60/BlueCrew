                                Culture is what give an organization its
                                power. It surrounds us and permeates everything
                                we do, binding us together for good or ill.
                                Whether we acknowledge it or not, there is
                                always power in our company's culture. Always.<br><br>

                                <strong>When we are intentional about driving positive
                                culture...</strong><br>
                                We can harness that power to increase
                                employee engagement and productivity.
                                Additionally, culture and brand go hand in hand,
                                so a strong positive culture can go a long way
                                toward positioning your company as a
                                front-runner in your industry.<br><br>
    
                                <strong>If we ignore culture, we do so at our own peril.</strong><br>
                                Culture exists regardless of our attentiveness.
                                When ignored, it can become toxic and
                                destructive, causing uncertainty and fear among
                                employees.  That fear can lead to anger, hate,

                                Gone are the days when employees were hired, put
                                to work, and evaluated annually  The workforce
                                is evolving, and thrives in an environment of
                                frequent feedback and recognition. Without such
                                an environment, not only do we have a failure to
                                communicate, we have an inability to develop and
                                retain engaged talent.<br><br>

                                <strong>Gather candid employee feedback.</strong><br>
                                An employee who feels understood plays with
                                a real cool hand.  Employees often have
                                great ideas, pertinent feedback, or serious
                                concerns that need to be recognized.
                                Without a well-established and safe channel
                                for feedback, employees will either suffer
                                in silence or eventually express their
                                feedback in unproductive ways.<br><br>Employee

                                <strong>Be proactive.</strong><br>
                                If you are hearing about discontent through the
                                grapevine, the problem is already out of hand.
                                Approach employees early and often to determine
                                what small measures can create huge returns.<br><br>


                                <strong>Recognize excellence in every employee.</strong>
                                A good manager recognizes that everyone has
                                opportunities for improvement.  Great managers
                                can identify moments of greatness in every
                                employee, even if they are not a natural born
                                world-shaker.  Shining a spotlight on those
                                moments effectively encourages our better angels
                                to overcome our lesser tendencies. <br><br>
                            
                                When we hold ourselves and others equally
                                accountable for success, then we can truly

                                You have got to believe. Operating from a growth
                                mindset, we realize that employees at any level
                                can grow, and can improve. This frame of mind
                                allows us to have a realistic expectation that
                                any employee, managed properly, can excel in

                                Every employee likes to know that there are
                                bigger things on the horizon. In most cases, it
                                is also advantageous to the company to have
                                just-in-time talent available to fill vacant
                                roles. Plan and implement your strategy to
                                avoid the difficulties associated with getting
                                new or unqualified talent up to speed.<br><br>

                                are laudable, but engaging with every employee
                                identically is like trying to eat fifty hard
                                boiled eggs in one sitting.  You are going to
                                lose more than a few.<br><br>

                                The old paradigm attempts to prove that the
                                employer made a good-faith effort to give the
                                employee ample opportunity to comply, but that
                                effort has been willfully rebuffed and there
                                fore the employer was left with no choice other
                                than termination.<br><br>
