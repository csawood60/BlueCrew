                            to make the most of its assets.  Buildings are
                            maintained, machinery is calibrated, and inventories
                            are rotated.  It is critical to success that
                            companies also not become complacent about their
                            largest investment: their human capital<br><br>

                            Great organizations are mindful to manage their
                            human capital carefully.  It is crucial to quantify
                            the value and expenses around your people assets so
                            that the effectiveness of any human capital
                            initiative can be evaluated.  Blue Ivy will identify
                            the metrics and costs that will allow you to manage
